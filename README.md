## Code organization notes

* The code in the `sf_history` subpackage maps galaxy properties onto halos. For example, the `mean_sfr` function maps SFR onto halos across time; this function needs to be integrated to map stellar mass onto halos. 
* The code in the `mock_obs` subpackage computes summary statistics of the galaxy population. The `numba_gw_hist` function calculates a Gaussian-weighted histogram, the kernel underlying a stellar mass function.  

## Getting Setup at BNL

1. Install miniconda. 
    
   I've been told it is better to keep it out of your home area, but that might just be my account. I made a directory on the 
   global scratch area, symlinked it to my home area, and then installed there. 
   
   The global scratch area is `/hpcgpfs01/scratch`.

2. Use `conda init` to setup your shell if you did not install it while doing miniconda.

This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained. The code is provided for historical reference and may contain unpatched or unknown vulnerabilities. It should not be used in production systems.


4. Add `module load "cuda/9.0"` to your `~/.bashrc`.

5. Install all of the software you need in your base conda env (e.g., `numba`, `pytest`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `jax`, etc.).

6. Get a node `srun --pty -A hackathon -N 1 --exclusive -p long -t 3:00:00 /bin/bash`
